# Digital-Bookstore-App
Application Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7LN2ZsVb4W3d0pWgV6d0ctdk8uuvFCv/view?usp=sharing
Desktop Application for Digital Bookstore using C# .NET Framework
The program simulates the application of a bookstore in which
users (readers and authors) interact and communicate through the application and its database at the same time.
The readers can purchase and evaluate a book and ask questions about a book.
On the other hand, the authors can view the sale statistics of their books and answer to readers' questions etc.
The challenge here is trying to manage 2 or more objects who communicate through the same database but the dont have the same role.
